# NFT Collection

A new NFT Collection defined by a Solidity Contract using the ERC-721 standard with the Enumerable Extension, which will be accessible through a web dapp using Next.js.

This collection will have a determined date on which it will be published and anyone can mint a NFT for themselves, and will use a previously created whitelist to allow early supporters to mint NFTs before the actual publication date.

## Characteristics of the collection
* There will be a limit of 20 NFTs, and each one of them will be a unique piece.  

* Users will only be able to mint 1 NFT per transaction.

* Whitelisted users will have a 5 minute window before the actual sale begin to mint NFTs.

* Each NFT should have a determined price defined in Ether ($ETH).
