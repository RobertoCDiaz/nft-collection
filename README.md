# NFT Collection

A new NFT Collection defined by a Solidity Contract using the ERC-721 standard with the Enumerable Extension, which will be accessible through a web dapp using Next.js.

This collection will have a determined date on which it will be published and anyone can mint a NFT for themselves, and will use a previously created whitelist to allow early supporters to mint NFTs before the actual publication date.
